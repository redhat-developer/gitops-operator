# OpenShift Gitops Service Operator

The Gitops Service Operator delivers and manages the backend which powers the OpenShift GitOps UI.
The service would be available at a well-known UI location.

# Getting started

## Making the operator available on the in-cluster OperatorHub

1. Add the following resource to your cluster

```
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: gitops-service-source
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  displayName: 'Gitops Service by Red Hat'
  image: 'quay.io/redhat-developer/gitops-backend-operator-index:v0.0.1'
  publisher: 'Red Hat Developer'
  sourceType: grpc
```

2. Go the OperatorHub on OpenShift Webconsole and look for the "Gitops Service" operator.

3. Install the operator using the defaults in the wizard, and wait for it to show up in the list of "Installed Operators". I it doesn't go check on it's status in the "Installed Operators" in the `openshift-operators` namespace.

4. To validate if the installation was successful, look for the route named `cluster` in the `openshift-gitops` namespace. Note, the namespace doesn't have to exist in advance, the operator creates it for you.

That's it, your API `route` should be created for you. You don't need to expliclty create any operand/CR.

## Contribute


1. Clone the repository.
2. Login to a cluster on your command-line.
3. `OPERATOR_NAME=gitops-operator operator-sdk run local --watch-namespace=openshift-gitops`

**Note:** Please check that you're using [operator-sdk]( https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/releases/tag/v0.17.2) version 0.17 or earlier. Since the community-operators do not support `v1` version of `CustomResourceDefinition`, the operator is using `v1beta1` version of `CustomResourceDefinition`.

## Tests

```
operator-sdk test local ./test/e2e --operator-namespace gitops-test --up-local
```

## Re-build and Deploy

This operator currently deploys the following payload.

```
quay.io/redhat-developer/gitops-backend:v0.0.1
```

If that's all what you are changing, the following steps are not needed in development
mode. You could update your image "payload" and re-install the operator.

* Build the operator image.

```
docker build -t quay.io/redhat-developer/gitops-backend-operator:v0.0.1
docker push quay.io/redhat-developer/gitops-backend-operator:v0.0.1
```


2. Build the Bundle image ( operator + OLM manifests )

```
operator-sdk bundle create quay.io/redhat-developer/gitops-backend-operator-bundle:v0.0.1
docker push quay.io/redhat-developer/gitops-backend-operator-bundle:v0.0.1
```

3. Build the Index image

```
opm index add --bundles quay.io/redhat-developer/gitops-backend-operator-bundle:v0.0.1  --tag quay.io/redhat-developer/gitops-backend-operator-index:v0.0.1 --build-tool=docker
docker push quay.io/redhat-developer/gitops-backend-operator-index:v0.0.1
```

The Index image powers the listing of the Operator on OperatorHub.
