# Info

This directory contains examples for testing gitops operator.

We used to use some of our personal github profiles in Kuttl testing repository as a repoURL. We decided to centralized location for storing them in gitops-operator repo and eliminate the dependency of personal account of a developer or QE. 

## How these examples are used?

We are using these examples in tests to create arogcd application and use to application to create scenarios to test functionalities of gitops-operator
