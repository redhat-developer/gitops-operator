                        Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.

                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
