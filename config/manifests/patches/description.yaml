  value: "Red Hat OpenShift GitOps is a declarative continuous delivery platform
    based on [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/). It enables teams to adopt
    GitOps principles for managing cluster configurations and automating secure and
    repeatable application delivery across hybrid multi-cluster Kubernetes environments.
    Following GitOps and infrastructure as code principles, you can store the configuration
    of clusters and applications in Git repositories and use Git workflows to roll
    them out to the target clusters.\n\n## Features\n* Automated install and upgrades
    of Argo CD\n* Manual and automated configuration sync from Git repositories to
    target OpenShift and Kubernetes clusters\n* Support for the Helm and Kustomize
    templating tools\n* Configuration drift detection and visualization on live clusters\n*
    Audit trails of rollouts to the clusters\n* Monitoring and logging integration
    with OpenShift\n* Automated GitOps bootstrapping using Tekton and Argo CD with
    [GitOps Application Manager CLI](https://github.com/redhat-developer/kam)\n\n##
    Components\n* Argo CD 2.7.2\n* GitOps Application Manager CLI ([download](https://github.com/redhat-developer/kam/releases))\n\n##
    How to Install \nAfter installing the OpenShift GitOps operator, an instance  of
    Argo CD is installed in the `openshift-gitops` namespace which has sufficent privileges
    for managing cluster configurations. You can create additional Argo CD instances
    using the `ArgoCD` custom resource within the desired namespaces.\n```yaml\napiVersion:
    argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: ArgoCD\nmetadata:\n  name: argocd\nspec:\n  server:\n
    \   route:\n      enabled: true\n```\n\nOpenShift GitOps is a layered product
    on top of OpenShift that enables teams to adopt GitOps principles for managing
    cluster configurations and automating secure and repeatable application delivery
    across hybrid multi-cluster Kubernetes environments. OpenShift GitOps is built
    around Argo CD as the core upstream project and assists customers to establish
    an end-to-end application delivery workflow on GitOps principles.\n"
